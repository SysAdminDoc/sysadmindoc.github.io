- [ ] P3: Let browsers without `style-src-elem` apply the site's own inline CSS
  Why: Browsers that don't know `style-src-elem` (Firefox before 108, Safari before 15.4) check an inline `<style>` against `style-src`, which is `'self'` alone, without the two hashes `style-src-elem` carries. So they refuse the critical CSS and the no-JS reveal block and draw the page unstyled until the stylesheet lands.
  Evidence: 33 stored reports with effective directive `style-src` and the site's own page as their source, 2026-08-20 to 2026-09-23. Samples from the 2026-09-23 sink change will show whether they're the critical CSS.
  Touches: `src/layouts/Base.astro` (`styleSrc`), `public/offline.html`, `scripts/audit-csp.mjs`, `test/csp-audit.test.mjs`.
  Acceptance: `style-src` carries the same hashes as `style-src-elem`, which changes nothing for browsers that use `style-src-elem`, and the samples of any new `style-src` reports are no longer the site's own blocks.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P3: Send `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` only with the Pagefind worker
  Why: Every page's policy allows WebAssembly compilation, but only the Pagefind worker behind `/search/` uses it, and a worker takes its policy from its own response header.
  Evidence: second drain review, 2026-09-23; `scriptSrc` in `src/layouts/Base.astro`; `/pagefind/pagefind-worker.js`.
  Touches: `deploy/vps/Caddyfile` (a route for the worker script that adds the keyword to the stamped header), `src/layouts/Base.astro`, `public/offline.html`, `astro.config.mjs`, `scripts/lib/csp-header.mjs`.
  Acceptance: Page policies drop `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` and the worker's header keeps it. The 11 search-corpus specs pass under production headers, and a `WebAssembly.compile` on an ordinary page is refused.
  Complexity: M

- [ ] P3: Show a readable page when a no-JavaScript form post meets a handler that is down
  Why: With the handler down, Caddy's `handle_errors` serves the 404 page, with a 502 status, to a visitor who posted without JavaScript, and their message is gone.
  Evidence: second drain review, 2026-09-23; the `handle_errors` block in `deploy/vps/Caddyfile`.
  Touches: `deploy/vps/Caddyfile`, a not-sent page under `src/pages/contact/`, `test/endpoint-header-contract.test.mjs`.
  Acceptance: A 5xx from `/api/contact` on a navigation shows a page saying the message wasn't sent and giving the email address, and a test pins the route.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P3: Take the em dashes out of the project descriptions
  Why: 41 descriptions in `src/data/projects.ts` join their halves with `&mdash;` (ImgConverter's among them), and they reach every catalog card, `rss.xml`, `atom.xml` and `feed.json`, which breaks the site's own writing rule. `title-style:audit` checks names only, not descriptions.
  Evidence: `git grep -c '&mdash;' src/data/projects.ts` gives 41 on 2026-09-24; 18 in `rss.xml`, 18 in `atom.xml` and 9 in `feed.json` in that day's build.
  Touches: `src/data/projects.ts`, a check over built descriptions (the feed audit or the title-style audit).
  Acceptance: No project description in `src/data` or in any built feed has an em dash or en dash, each rewritten as a sentence rather than a mechanical swap, and a build check keeps it that way.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P3: Publish GitHub releases for v0.43.0 through v0.45.x
  Why: Releases stop at v0.42.0 while tags reach v0.45.2, and the README still runs `smoke:release` against a v0.43.0 asset that doesn't exist.
  Evidence: `gh release list` on 2026-09-22; `README.md:94`.
  Touches: the release steps in `README.md`, `scripts/smoke-release-artifact.mjs`.
  Acceptance: Each minor version from v0.43.0 has a release with the static-site ZIP and its SHA-256, and `smoke:release` passes against the newest one.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P3: Check the server's own contact settings and backups against /privacy/
  Why: `CONTACT_RETENTION_DAYS` set in the server-side `contact-secrets.env` would override the default the page is built from, and the privacy test can't see that file. A backup of the `contact-data` volume would outlive the 365-day purge.
  Evidence: third drain review; `test/privacy-retention.test.mjs` reads only the committed compose file.
  Touches: `scripts/deploy-vps.mjs` (refuse to deploy when the live env file sets a retention the page doesn't state), the VPS backup scripts in Contabo-VPS-Ops.
  Acceptance: A deploy fails on a mismatched retention in the live env, and no backup keeps a lead longer than the page says.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P3: Serve the token's minimum age with the token
  Why: `public/scripts/contact-form.js` and the lead-delivery smoke wait a hard-coded 3.5 s, while the handler's minimum is `CONTACT_MIN_TIME`. Raising that past 3.5 s would make every scripted send fail its first try.
  Evidence: third drain review; `contact-form.js` `MIN_TOKEN_AGE_MS`, `scripts/lib/lead-delivery-check.mjs`.
  Touches: `deploy/vps/contact-handler.mjs` (return `minAgeMs` beside the token), `public/scripts/contact-form.js`, `scripts/lib/lead-delivery-check.mjs`.
  Acceptance: With `CONTACT_MIN_TIME=5` the page script and the smoke both send on the first try.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P3: Make `staleAfter` the earliest of the data's own deadlines
  Why: `/status.json` `staleAfter` follows `_stats.json` `fetchedAt` only, while the profile feed and the catalog check keep their own 36-hour clocks.
  Evidence: third drain review; `src/data/generated-trust.ts`.
  Touches: `src/data/generated-trust.ts`, `src/pages/status.json.ts`, `test/generated-data-trust.test.mjs`.
  Acceptance: `staleAfter` is the earliest expiry of the three, and a test with a stale feed but fresh stars shows it.
  Complexity: S

- [ ] P3: Match the CSP host audit to how browsers check a prefetch
  Why: `scripts/lib/csp-host-usage.mjs` counts a `rel=prefetch` against the directive its `as` names, but CSP Level 3 checks prefetches against `default-src`.
  Evidence: third drain review, from the spec; not yet tested in a browser.
  Touches: `scripts/lib/csp-host-usage.mjs`, `test/csp-host-usage.test.mjs`.
  Acceptance: A Chromium and a Firefox check show which directive governs a cross-origin prefetch, and the audit maps it the same way.
  Complexity: S
